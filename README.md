Coding journey — Weeks 1–2 (first public update)

This is a public log of my first two weeks learning Python and building small projects. I’m doing 4 hours/day and documenting progress so I can look back, demonstrate consistency, and improve faster.

What I have coded so far:

Currency converter — with input validation and error handling.

Mini calculator — basic arithmetic functions.

FizzBuzz — classic control-flow exercise.

Random number generator / guesser — simple interactive program.

To-Do list — CLI app with save / load / add / delete functionality. (Although I still find filing difficult)

Rock-Paper-Scissors game

These are the key skills I have learned so far:

Data types: strings, integers, floats.

Collections: lists, dictionaries, sets.

Flow control: for, while, if / elif / else.

Functions and basic modularisation.

Indexing / slicing (splicing).

range() and loops.

Importing modules.

Basic file I/O (for the To-Do save/load).

Starting to use try / except for error handling (dabbled).

Whilst I have learned these concepts, I obviously haven't mastered them yet... 2 weeks in.

My Current Pitfalls:

I’m still unclear about when and why to use GitHub beyond uploading code, so here I am, testing the waters. 

My plan for Weeks 3 & 4:

Deepen Python idioms (list comprehensions, lambda/map/filter and cleaner function-based code).

Continue to dripfeed LeetCode practice (medium → hard) to build pattern recognition and time/space intuition.

Complete CS fundamentals (CS50x/Odin modules on arrays, memory and functions).

Create new and polish existing projects (Rock paper scissors project + To-Do), improve READMEs/screenshots, and learn more about Git.

I will aim to update this every fortnight.

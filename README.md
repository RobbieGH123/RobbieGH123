# Coding journey — Weeks 1–2 (first public update)

This is a public log of my first two weeks learning Python and building small projects. 

## Projects Completed Weeks 0-2

Currency converter — with input validation and error handling.

Mini calculator — basic arithmetic functions.

FizzBuzz — classic control-flow exercise.

Random number generator / guesser — simple interactive program.

To-Do list — CLI app with save / load / add / delete functionality. (Although I still find filing difficult)

Rock-Paper-Scissors game - Demonstration of functions, input handling, import, random tools.

------------------------------------------------------

## These are the key skills I have learned so far:

Data types: strings, integers, floats.

Collections: lists, dictionaries, sets.

Flow control: for, while,  if/elif/else.

Functions and basic modularisation.

Indexing / slicing (splicing).

range() and loops.

Importing modules.

Basic file I/O (for the To-Do save/load).

Try / except for error handling (dabbled).

Note: Understood only, none yet mastered.

---------------------------------------------

## My Current Pitfalls:

GitHub - How to navigate
File Management

## My plan for Weeks 3 & 4:

Deepen Python idioms (list comprehensions, lambda/map/filter and cleaner function-based code).

Continue to dripfeed LeetCode practice (medium → hard) to build pattern recognition and time/space intuition.

Complete CS fundamentals (CS50x/Odin modules on arrays, memory and functions).

Create new and polish existing projects (Rock paper scissors project + To-Do), improve
READMEs/screenshots, and learn more about Git.

*This README will be updated regularly as I progress through my coding journey, typically, every 14 study days.*
